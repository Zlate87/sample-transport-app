## Intro
Sample application that showcases displaying of transportation data.

It shows:
* Architecture base practices.
* How to use RX java for long running tasks instead of AsyncTask.
* How to work with JSON data.
* How to handle models not appropriate for the views by introducing view models.
* How to do simple data manipulation with joda-time.
* Have compile time dependency injection with Dagger 2.
* How to do JUnit tests with robolectric, mockito, how to mock final classes with powermock.
* How to do UI tests with Espresso.
* Working with flavors.
* ...

It doesnâ€™t show:
* As you can see from the screenshots, how to create a fancy UI.
* How to implement animations 
* How to reading data from backend
* ...

## Developer Guide
The application has two flavors:
* dummyData - It contains flavors specific routing service that will always return a dummy route from JSON file that is pre-bundled with the application. This flavors allows testing independent of a server
* production - It is intended to have specific routing service that will retrieve data from a server for given routing parameters. However at the moment the routing service is not implemented and it throws a RuntimeException and crashes the application.
 

### Building
* The application is using Dagger 2 for dependency injection. Sine Dagger 2 works at compile time, some classes need to be generated. These classes are generated automatically and are not committed. Because of this, the project must be built once after it is cloned or Android Studio will show errors (missing Dagger generated classes).

* The application is using Google Maps, and for it to work it needs Maps API key. The API key is committed (see [google_maps_api.xml](https://github.com/Zlate87/sample-transport-app/blob/master/app/src/main/res/values/google_maps_api.xml)), but it works only if the application is signed with the signing key that the API key is for. The signing key is not committed (it is a secret :)). So in order for the maps to work properly you will need to generate a new API key that will be pared to your signing key. More about how to do this [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-api/signup?hl=en).

### Testing
The application has JUnit tests that focuses  on testing the services and Espresso test that focuses  on testing the activities and UI elements by mocking the services. At the moment there are no end-to-end tests.

#### JUnit tests
The application comes with robolectric tests (more information about robolectric [here](http://robolectric.org/)). To run the robolectric tests, on the command line run:
```
gradlew test
```
#### Espresso tests
The application comes with espresso tests (more information about espresso [here](https://google.github.io/android-testing-support-library/docs/espresso/index.html)). To run the tests from gradle, on the command line run:
```
gradlew connectedAndroidTest
```
NOTE - when running the espresso test, make sure that: 
* The animations are disabled on the device where the tests are running. More info [here](https://google.github.io/android-testing-support-library/docs/espresso/setup/index.html#running-tests).
* If running the tests on Android 6.0 or up, the ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION permission is granted. This can be done manually of using adb command:
```
 adb shell pm grant "com.zlate87.sample_transport_app.[FLAVOR_NAME]" android.permission.android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION
 ```

## Third party libraries
* [Android Support Libraries](http://developer.android.com/tools/support-library/index.html) for backward compatibility
* [Google Play Services](https://developers.google.com/android/guides/overview) for displaying a route on Google Maps.
* [Moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi) for JSON parsing.
* [Dagger 2](http://google.github.io/dagger/) for dependency injection.
* [Guava](https://github.com/google/guava) for reading files from file. I know that Guava is big, but that is not something proguard can't handle.
* [RxAndroid](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxAndroid) for long running tasks instead of AsyncTask.
* [joda-time-android](https://github.com/dlew/joda-time-android) for date manipulations.
* [Google Maps Android API utility library (android-maps-utils)](https://github.com/googlemaps/android-maps-utils)
* [Robolectric](http://robolectric.org/) for mocking the Android framework in JUnit tests
* [mockito](http://mockito.org/) for mocking.
* [Hamcrest](http://hamcrest.org/JavaHamcrest/) for matchers.
* [PowerMock](https://github.com/jayway/powermock) for mocking the final classes like GoogleMap when testing the route map service. 
* [Espresso](https://google.github.io/android-testing-support-library/docs/espresso/index.html) for UI tests.
